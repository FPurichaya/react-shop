Hello,

My name is Pawe≈Ç and this is my project to practice JavaScript FullStack Developer skills.

Master is online here: https://hire.me.fraczyk.eu/ 

This is the FrontEnd part. You can find BackEnd in 'practice-react-api' folder in the main repository account.

It is also needed to start mongoDB to get it worked all together. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
