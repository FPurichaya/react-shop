Currently I'm working on the CI/CD with CircleCi and AWS CodeDeploy which is working. It contains very first version of AWS infrastructure provided via terraform which it will be upgraded within the time.


TODO in upcoming week (05.01 - 12.01.2020)
- make ssm agent working to get credentials from AWS SM Parameter Store
- create dynamoDB table via terraform
- connect backend (api service) with dynamodDB using SDK
- create production env in Dockerfiles
